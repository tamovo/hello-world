Repository "Repo" is the place where you can save the file and change the file.

Commit your files means save your files.

(main linear list of commits) by default as "master" in a master branch
-> . -> . ->. 

What if you have a experimental try to add for the file. Not sure if I want to keep it.

                    >. (fairies)
                  /
-> . -> . ->. -> . ->.
             \       /
               > . ->(unicorn)

When you try to update the unicorn branch to a master branch.
pull request, pull something in from somebody
push request, send something to somebody
merge

If you have merge conflict, edit the files and delete from <<<<<<  ====== and >>>>>>>>, to see which line you want to use.
Complete the desired file and mark as resolved.
